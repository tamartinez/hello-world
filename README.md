Here's my about me!

My name is Thomas Martinez. 
I'm a recent Grad from the University of Houston with a Bachelors in Communications - Advertising.
I enjoy photography and roaming Houston looking for cool shots. You do to? Let me know! I'd enjoy getting shots (of whiskey) with you and then capturing photos of the town haha
